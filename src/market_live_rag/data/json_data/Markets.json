    "full_text": "The dollar slid to a six-month low on Tuesday as progress on US-China tensions led investors to higher-risk assets, while a year-end rally that lifted global equity markets to record highs stayed alive on the last trading day of 2019. A gauge of world stock markets and stocks on Wall Street rebounded late in the session after trading lower most of the day, marking an end to a remarkable year for investors. Many equity indices, long-term bonds, oil and gold posted double-digit gains in 2019. US President Donald Trump said the Phase 1 pact with China would be signed on January 15 at the White House, though confusion remains about details of the agreement. The hope of an imminent deal has been a key driver for lifting global equities to their best year since 2009, up 24 percent for the year and 88 percent for the decade. MSCI's all-country world index of stock performance in 49 nations rose 0.86 point or 0.15 percent, to 565.24. Stocks skid in Asia, dollar dips on war risk Goldman Sachs tops Wall Street for fourth quarter ECM revenue Asian stocks head for fourth weekly gain on tech The index is less than 3 points shy of an all-time high set on Friday when the three major US indices also posted record peaks. The breakthrough in US-China talks and a British election earlier in December pointing to a smoother exit from the European Union have boosted investor sentiment, but the outlook for equities next year is not as buoyant, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. \"This is a year in which everybody will celebrate,\" he said. Going forward, however, Kelly said it will be hard to achieve similar gains, with US equities likely to advance by mid-single digits annually for several years. International markets, especially emerging markets, are poised to do better, he said. \"The US stock market rally could continue but at some stage, there's going to be a significant correction, and the it goes up, the it's going to correct,\" he said. In shortened trading sessions ahead of New Year's Eve celebrations, the pan-European STOXX 600 index closed down 0.08 percent. French, British and Spanish listed stocks lost between 0.1 percent and 0.7 percent, while Frankfurt and Milan bourses were shut for the year-end holidays. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 76.3 points, or 0.27 percent, to 28,538.44 and the S&P 500 gained 9.49 points, or 0.29 percent, to 3,230.78. The Nasdaq Composite added 26.61 points, or 0.3 percent, to 8,972.60. Emerging market stocks lost 0.34 percent. Bourses in Asia diverged. China mainland stocks gained 0.4 percent after data showed manufacturing activity in the world's second-largest economy expanded for a second straight month in December. China's Purchasing Managers' Index showing economic trends in the manufacturing and service sectors was unchanged at 50.2 in December from November, but still remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. In Hong Kong, stocks fell 0.5 percent as protesters geared up for pro-democracy rallies on New Year's Eve. Markets in Japan and South Korea were closed for a holiday. The dollar's slide came close to wiping out the year's gains, as the pound and -sensitive currencies rallied on improving US-China relations and the outlook for global growth. The decline of the dollar is one of the biggest bets in the FX market for 2020. \"We could be right at a turning point where global growth re-accelerates relative to US growth, and that could mean a weaker dollar over time,\" Kelly said. The dollar was strong for much of 2019 thanks to the relative outperformance of the US economy and investors' preference for a safe-haven currency amid the dispute. But the dollar's gains for the year shriveled in December. Investors bought up currencies linked to global , sending the Australian dollar, Chinese yuan and Scandinavian crowns to multi-month or multi-week highs against the greenback. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six currencies, fell 0.237 point or 0.24 percent, to 96.503 and the euro was last up 0.14 percent, at $1.1213. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.22 percent versus the greenback at 108.65 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3245, up 1.01 percent on the day. The weak dollar helped lift spot gold to its highest since September 25 at $1,525.20 an ounce. The metal was set to post its biggest yearly gain since 2010, rising than 18 percent. US gold futures settled up 0.3 percent at $1,523.10. The benchmark US Treasury 10-year note fell 7/32 in price to yield 1.9192 percent. Longer-dated Treasuries were on track to post their best return since 2014, after concerns about the slowing US economy prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates three times this year. The move was a major reason for Wall Street's gains. Thirty-year bonds returned 17.15 percent this year through Monday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, while 10-year notes have returned 9.03 percent. The final data will not be updated until late on Tuesday. Oil fell but was still on track for monthly and annual gains, supported by a thaw in the prolonged US-China row and the Middle East unrest. Brent crude settled down 67 cents at $66.00 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude slid 62 cents to settle at $61.06 a barrel. Brent has gained about 23 percent in 2019 and WTI has risen 34 percent, their best yearly gains in three years."

    "full_text": "Shitij Gandhi Indian markets began this week on a muted note with some lackluster moves. However, in Tuesday’s session, rs lock profits at higher levels as markets ended the last trading session of 2019 on a negative note. rs were seen focusing on stock-specific moves rather than the index as some mid-cap names performed during the last few sessions. From the derivative front, Call writers were seen at 12300, 12250 & 12200 strikes which added hefty open interest (OI) and kept the markets under pressure. From the technical front as well, 12300 levels should act as crucial resistance for the Nifty moving forward, because at current juncture the divergences on secondary oscillators on the daily and weekly intervals suggest further consolidation into the prices. Budget unlikely to offer big consumption sops; India to stay stable amid global shocks... Davos diaries, Coal India’s next stake sale &amp; Bill Gates' push for clean ammonia Davos 2026: Andrew Ng’s exclusive interview; Martin Sorrell bullish on India & PM Modi; and Gr... However, a decisive move above 12300 levels in the Nifty (SPOT) should once again trigger a fresh round of short-covering by call writers which could take markets towards new record highs in the coming week. On the downside 12,100, and 12,000 levels would act as key support levels for the Nifty and any dip into the prices should be used to create fresh longs. Here is a list of top three stocks which could give 7-14% return in the next 3-4 weeks: Axis Bank: Buy| LTP: Rs 754| Target: Rs 810| Stop Loss: Rs 715| Upside 7% The stock has been consistently maintaining its bull run on the daily as well as the weekly interval as prices are holding above its short and long-term moving averages. The stock is trading in a rising channel with the formation of higher highs and higher lows. At the current juncture, the stock has formed an inverted head shoulder pattern on the daily interval and gave a breakout above the same. Additionally, the positive divergences on the secondary oscillators also suggest for the next up leg into the prices. rs can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 750-755 for the upside target of Rs 810 levels, and a stop loss could be placed below Rs 715. DCM Shriram: Buy| LTP: Rs 396| Target: Rs 451| Stop Loss: Rs 360| Upside 14% After testing Rs 310 levels on the downside in November’19, the stock has been consistently recovering from its lows and was seen trading in a rising channel on the daily as well as the weekly interval. The stock has been forming a higher highs and higher bottom pattern. At the current juncture, the stock has given a fresh breakout on multiple time frames with marginally higher volumes. On the daily charts, the stock has also managed to close above its long-term moving averages which is again a positive signal for the prices moving forward. rs can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 395-397 for the upside target of Rs 451 levels, and a stop loss could be placed below Rs 360. Bata India: Buy| LTP: Rs 1750| Target: Rs 1895| Stop Loss: Rs 1650| Upside 8% In the recent past, the stock took support at Rs 1600 levels and also at its 100-Days exponential moving average (EMA) on the daily charts, to once again reclaim Rs 1,720 levels in a short span of time. At the current juncture, the stock has formed an Inverted head and shoulder pattern on the daily interval. The breakout above the neckline of the pattern formation has also been observed this week which suggests for further upside into the prices moving forward. rs can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 1735-1750 for the upside target of Rs 1895 levels, and a stop loss can be placed below Rs 1650.

Broader indices underperform but these 27 small-cap stocks gain up to 62% Wall Street’s major indexes edged higher on Tuesday on a renewed rally fueled by optimism, capping off a decade of handsome returns in which the benchmark S&P 500 rose nearly 190%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 76.3 points, or 0.27%, to 28,538.44, the S&P 500 gained 9.49 points, or 0.29%, to 3,230.78 and the Nasdaq Composite added 26.61 points, or 0.3%, to 8,972.60. SGX Nifty Trends on SGX Nifty indicate a negative opening for the broader indices in India, a loss of 87.50 points or 0.71 percent. Nifty futures were trading around 12,239-level on the Singaporean Exchange. Oil posts biggest yearly rise since 2016 Oil prices fell 1% on Tuesday, the last trading day of the decade, but notched the biggest annual gain in three years, supported by a thaw in the prolonged US-China war and ongoing supply cuts from major oil producers. Brent gained about 23% in 2019 and WTI rose 34%, their biggest yearly gains in three years, backed by the recent breakthrough in the talks and output cuts pledged by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies. Indian Railways announces fare hike effective from January 1 On the New Year's eve, the railways announced fare hike across its network, excluding suburban trains, effective from January 1, 2020, according to an order issued on December 31.

The railways also announced a two paise/km hike in fares of mail/express non-AC trains and four paise/km hike in the fares of AC classes. Premium trains like Shatabdi, Rajdhani and Duronto trains are included in the fare hike. Fed sees small take-up of repo, rates fall for year-end The Federal Reserve averted a year-end funding squeeze on Tuesday as large banks took only a small portion of $150 billion on offer in its last overnight repo operation of 2019, and the cost of borrowing fell to its lowest level since March 2018. The New York Federal Reserve has been injecting liquidity into the repo market to reduce the chance of funding stress after a flare-up in September sent the cost of overnight loans as high as 10%, than four times the Fed’s rate at the time. That had caused particular concern about the year-end. “It looks like what the Fed did worked,” said Tom Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies in New York. “The Fed acted out of an abundance of caution, and fortunately the result was a very calm year-end here so far.” Trump says US-China deal will be signed on January 15 US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Phase 1 of an American deal with China would be signed on Jan. 15 at the White House. The president wrote in a tweet that he would sign the deal with \"high level representatives of China\" and that he would later travel to Beijing to begin talks on the next phase. Mega infra spend can be a trigger for boosting growth: ICRA At a time when the overall economic growth is slowing, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's announcement of Rs 102 lakh crore worth of investment in infrastructure projects over the next five years, can be a trigger for boosting growth, says ICRA. According to the rating agency, the construction sector is likely to be a major beneficiary of this increased investment. The finance minister on December 31 announced the infrastructure project pipeline for the next five years that will help the country nearly double the size of the GDP to $5 trillion by 2025. RBI asks large UCBs to constitute Board of Management The Reserve Bank on December 31 asked all urban cooperative banks (UCBs) with deposits of over Rs 100 crore to constitute a Board of Management (BoM) comprising experts to oversee their functioning. The decision assumes significance against the backdrop of a scam at Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank leading to hardships to over 9 lakh depositors. CAD narrows to 0.9% of GDP in July-Sept on lower deficit: RBI The current account deficit (CAD) narrowed to 0.9 percent of GDP or $6.3 billion in the July-September quarter of the current fiscal from 2.9 percent or $19 billion in same period last year, according to the RBI data. In the first quarter, the deficit stood at 2 percent of GDP or $14.2 billion. \"The contraction in the CAD was primarily on account of a lower deficit at $38.1 billion as compared with $50 billion a year ago,\" RBI said in a release. Core sector output shrinks by 1.5% in November Contracting for the fourth consecutive month, the output of eight core infrastructure industries shrank by 1.5 percent in November 2019 as five of the eight sectors witnessed negative growth, according to official data released on December 31.

It was a historic year for D-Street as Sensex made a new high above 41,800 while Nifty50 came close to 12,300 levels. The year 2020 will also be a year when benchmark indices will hit new milestones and probably Nifty will surpass 13,000 levels and 45,000 mark for Sensex, suggest experts.

Since 2012, the stock has rallied over 360 percent. Dabur is planning to expand into healthcare, foods and personal care segment by acquiring new companies and reviving its sales. It is also looking towards increased rural penetration by increasing its rural network to cover up to 55,000 villages. Manappuram Finance: The stock has d at a record high of Rs 178 and has rallied over 90 percent in the calendar year 2019 so far. Price has formed higher highs & higher lows formation in the broader time frame. The financials of Manappuram Finance Ltd show net sales growth of 16.79 percent and core EBITDA growth of 20.58 percent. The company has jotted down 4.92 percent ROA (Return on Assets), 19.40 percent ROE (Return on Equity) and 14.34 percent ROCE (Return on Capital employed). The net sales growth of the company being 16.79 percent, core EBITDA growth being 20.58 percent and PAT growth of 14.71 percent signify the sound operations and a profitable business model which provides good scope for appreciation of the stock. ICICI Securities: In calendar year 2019, the stock has d with volatility in first two-months with stock price declining as much as 27.63 percent, and after consolidating in a narrow range, stock price gained over 110 percent since August 2019. This stock seems to be very promising because of its 46.85 percent Return on Equity and 32.73 percent Return on Assets. With changing business model i.e. shifting from pure broking to an array of other services like advisory services, wealth management etc., could reduce the volatility in earnings and revenue. Dividend pay-out ratio of 2.20 is a very lucrative aspect which might give rise to a lot of bullish sentiments along with a cash surplus balance sheet which is icing on the cake. Affle (India): The stock was listed on NSE in August 2019 and has jumped as much as 87.8 percent from its listing price within four months. With a ROA of 20.10 percent, ROE of 43.64 percent, & ROCE of 62.77 percent, it can be said that this is a profitable business. It has had an EBITDA growth of 58.79 percent and PAT growth of 88.87 percent which shows its sound revenue from operations thus it can be a stock with great potential. Adani Enterprises: The financials of this organisation boast figures of 14.52 percent ROCE (Return on Capital Employed), 13.62% of ROE and 3.3 percent of ROA along with Net sales growth of 38.36 percent.

Expert: Ritesh Asher ŌĆō Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) at KIFS Capital Bharat Electronics (BEL): The Company has 37 percent market share in Indian Defense Electronics. Its core capabilities are in radar, and weapons systems, defense communication & electronic warfare. It derives incremental contributions from non-defense segments like homeland security, cybersecurity, and smart cities, which are expected to contribute ~20 percent to the revenue albeit with lower margins over the next three to five years.

The company had a dedicated workforce of over 180,000 serving clients across 6 continents.

In the Feed segment, which contributes ~78 percent of total revenues, although the industry consumption growth is expected to be flat, the company expects growth of 12-15%, driven by market share gains (48% vs. 45% YoY). The recent improvement witnessed in farm-gate and stabilization in export prices provides a better outlook for both Feed & Processing segments.

Further, management expects a revival in the economy and thus it continues to focus on strengthening its presence by increasing market share, expanding distribution reach in both rural and urban areas, premiumizing and launching innovative products, steady capacity addition and improved product mix. Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Company (RNAM): RNAM is one of the leading AMCs in India with a total AUM of ~Rs. 4,530 bn. The buyout by Nippon Life Insurance (75% ownership currently) from Reliance Capital removes the overhang on RNAM. Further, the company has taken several initiatives in order to rebrand and strengthen the balance sheet which would help regain lost market share and thereby would narrow the valuation difference with HDFC AMC.

    "full_text": "Infrastructure has been in focus in the last six years, and both the States and the Centre have spent Rs 51 lakh crore on infrastructure projects, which will be continued by spending than Rs 100 lakh crore in the next five years, said Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, while addressing her last press conference for 2019. She further said the task force of the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) after holding 70 stakeholders' consultations on infrastructure investment in four months, recommendedÂ investments of Rs 102 lakh crore. The government will be adding Rs 3 lakh crore to Rs 102 lakh crore in two-three days, taking the total investment to Rs 105 lakh crore to boost the infrastructure sector, she said. Sitharaman also said that infrastructure projects are spread across 18 states and union territories. The share of private sectors in infrastructure projects pipeline will be at 22 percent while that of Central and State governments will have 39 percent share each in National Infra Pipeline, she said. Retail equity s continue to trail benchmarks as weak returns test investor patience: Kotakâ... Base metals rally on supply crunch, AI-infra demand; experts see selective upside ahead Trading Plan: Will Nifty 50 sustain below 25,600, Bank Nifty below 60,000 amid rising VIX? \"Projects worth Rs 42.7 lakh crore are under implementation, with 63 percent of the total infrastructure project pipeline has already been firmed up,\" Sitharaman said, adding that power, rail, renewables, urban, irrigation, mobility, water, heath and digital formed the bulk of the crore projects. She said the private share in national infra pipeline at 22 percent would increase to 30 pecent by 2025. \"We are looking at various steps to reform PPP projects and dispute resolution. We are also looking at various steps towards the enforcement of contracts,\" she said, adding a robust monitoring framework will be established. Experts feel this is definitely a positive move for not only infrastructure, but also construction and cement stocks. \"The big infra push by the government was expected since the Task Force had submitted its recommendations. What was awaited was the details of the funding and the initiatives to fix the issues in the PPP model and dispute resolution. The proposed infra spend spread across 18 states and union territories can be expected to give a fillip to revival of growth,\" V K Vijaykumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol. He said from the market perspective, this was certainly a sentiment positive. Capital goodsÂ and infrastructure stocks will respond positively, he feels. Renu Baid of IIFL Institutional Equities also said it was definitely a positive move from government as there were concerns about capex on infrastructure and investment from government. \"There could be near term hiccups about the timing, but from medium-to-long term, it is very strong move. In fact, this was requirement of the day from the government to give a push to the infrastructure sector,\" she added. She said the move is positive for infrastructure companies like L&T, E&P firms etc, though there are still some challenges for next two quarters. \"We need to see how the government will provide better environment for private companies and drive demand going forward.\" \"If we look at construction and infrastructure related companies, this step was on expected lines. We have to wait and watch the implementation,\" Sudip Bandyopadhyay, Group Chairman of Indi Capital told CNBC-TV18. \"Private sector participation has been pegged at 22 percent initially, which is supposed to go up to 30 percent by 2025. That will be the critical component as we have to wait and watch what kind of private sector participation comes in in terms of investment in infrastructure projects, considering the state of private sector and availability of credit to large corporates,\" he said. Bandyopadhyay said that L&T, and other large road construction names Dilip Buildcon, Sadbhav Infrastructure etc will be on his radar. He also said that cement, which have not done well in the last six months, have not been his favourite, but he would continue to remain bullish, and all this infrastructure spend would definitely percolate back to good performance in cement companies. \"Companies having capacities in the north and the centre would be attractive, considering the supply-demand status there. The possibility of having an upper hand as far as pricing is concerned, JK Cement, HeidelbergCement will definitely on my radar,\" he added. Several infrastructure stocks reacted to the news, which came in late on December 31. IRB Infrastructure, KNR Constructions, Dilip Buildcon, Ashoka Buildcon, PNC Infratech etc gained up to 7 percent.

    "full_text": "Abhishek Goenka The year 2019 saw the domestic economy stutter and stall. To put it in the words of former RBI governor Dr Raghuram Rajan, we are in the middle of a \"Growth Recession\". Household, corporate, bank and government balance sheets are all stressed at the same time. Private consumption has slowed, private CAPEX is virtually non-existent and exports have failed to pick up. Corporates are wary of investing and banks are wary of lending. Despite all the current gloom, we remain optimistic about the economy bouncing back in 2020. It is not likely to be a V-shaped recovery but we are likely to see a gradual revival if policymakers play the cards right. Several structural reforms being unleashed at once have strangulated the economy. It is important that the policymakers ensure that the structural reforms go the full distance without resorting to quick fixes at this stage. It is crucial that we make the most of the slowdown i.e. deleverage and re-leverage in a manner that makes the future economic growth enduring and sustainable. We are seeing some green shoots in the form of a sequential rise in auto sales, domestic air traffic and fuel demand. A rise in headline CPI has been primarily on account of higher vegetable prices. Higher headline CPI and stable core CPI would help in correcting the terms of for farmers and this should aid the rural economy. We would watch for progress on ing themes to calibrate our growth outlook for the coming quarters: Unclogging of credit channels Despite abundant liquidity in the system, banks are still averse to lending. Thanks to the asset quality review, we now have a fair idea of the full extent of NPAs in the system. Addressing a few big accounts expeditiously would go a long way in shifting banks' focus from NPA resolution to lending. The resolution of Essar Steel under the Bankruptcy Code is an encouraging sign. The decision to admit financial institutions into the resolution mechanism is a step in the right direction. However, we need a different mechanism for the resolution of stressed SME loans as it would be very time consuming if all of them are put through the same process. Besides recognition and resolution, we also need reforms and tighter regulations. Merging of public sector banks needs to be ed up with ensuring that their credit due diligence process is revamped. Recapitalising PSBs without strengthening their corporate governance would be a quick fix and a moral hazard. Land & labour reforms Though these are politically difficult to pull off, they are the need of the hour. Ease of doing business cannot be achieved in a true sense without addressing the issues pertaining to the two most important factors of production. Large scale mega infrastructure projects would not see the light of the day unless and until land reforms are initiated. We would not be able to invite the global firms looking to restructure their supply chains to look at India until we enhance our competitiveness through these reforms. The Land Acquisition Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill had failed to pass through the Rajya Sabha in 2015. This government has shown the will and courage to enact tough socio-political reforms. It is now time for tough economic reforms. Judicious use of fiscal space The government exhausted precious fiscal space by cutting corporate taxes this year. Though this was a much-needed reform as Corporate taxes in India were much higher than the OECD average, the timing of it was questionable. A temporary cut in indirect taxes would have been effective in stimulating the stalling economy by pushing up demand. However, it is important now that the government ensures that it increases the share of capital expenditure as a part of total expenditure in the upcoming budget. Government spending was the engine that prevented Q2 growth numbers from looking even worse. As long as the spending is directed towards infrastructure, the markets would not be too perturbed even if it entails higher fiscal slippage. We believe a fiscal deficit of 3.7-3.8 percent for FY20 is already being priced in by the bond markets. A Rs 100 lakh crore investment in infrastructure sounds ambitious. Even a fraction of it would be welcome at this point. On the income side, the government should continue working towards ensuring GST compliance, widening the tax base and also continue with its focus on strategic stake sales. Monetary policy transmission Despite the 135bps rate cut in the current cycle, lending rates to the real economy continue to remain almost unchanged. This is because the banks are risk-averse and are looking to repair their balance sheets. They have therefore not passed on the benefit of rate cuts to borrowers. Transmission into bonds has been weak as well due to fiscal slippage concerns. The spread of the 10y benchmark yield over the Repo is extremely high. The RBI has attempted to address this by recently announcing a switch/twist wherein it would sell shorter maturity papers and buy long-maturity bonds (the current on the run 10y benchmark to be precise). This is intended to flatten the yield curve. A lot of borrowing is linked to the 10y year benchmark G-sec yield. Keeping it suppressed would reduce the cost of borrowing for long gestation capital intensive infrastructure projects. We expect such switches going forward. We believe we are at the bottom of the current rate cycle as inflation prints could surprise on the upside in the next few months. However, we expect the RBI to remain on a prolonged pause. Opening up of capital account Considering the need for channelizing foreign savings into domestic assets, we expect gradual opening up of our capital account. We expect FDI norms to be liberalized and FPI limits in bonds to be increased. However, FPIs are currently utilizing only 75 percent of their available limit in Government bonds and 60 percent in corporate bonds. Therefore, an increase in FPI limits may have to be accompanied by other reforms to increase the allure. There is a possibility of inclusion in a global bond index in a phased manner. Availability of a wider array of hedging options onshore, an extension of FX market timings would also facilitate FPI participation. We expect the trend of overseas fundraising by Indian corporates in the form of ECBs/FCCBs/Equity to continue in 2020. The RBI is likely to continue mopping up inflows to prevent the Rupee from appreciating in relative terms and to shore up its FX kitty. Market view Given the importance of capital inflows, we expect the RBI to perform a delicate balancing act of keeping the rupee competitive and containing volatility. The “RBI put” in USD-INR is likely to continue in 2020 as well. We expect the downside in USD-INR to be limited. The level of 10 on CNH-INR is likely to act as a floor. We expect USD-INR to in a 69.65-75.20 range through 2020. The US Federal Reserve is expected to keep rates on hold through 2020. Unless a possibility of the Fed hiking earlier than 2021 emerges, we do not see a runaway move higher in USD-INR. We expect the 10y benchmark bond yield to in 6.25-7.25 percent band in 2020 and expect the spread of corporate bonds over government bonds to narrow. In the equities segment, we expect the Nifty to consolidate its gains in 2020 and see the broader markets catching up with the index. The key risks to the above view would be a break out in crude prices above $85 per barrel and earlier than expected tightening by the US Federal Reserve. (The author is CEO & founder, IFA Global.

    "full_text": "Deepak Jasani India is undergoing a big transformation period, which in the interim has impacted business activities/sentiments and demand in the economy. Global cues seem to be stabilising, while the local economic data still needs to improve. The monsoon has been reasonably good. These factors will have an impact on urban and rural consumption. These developments along with the measures announced by the government over the past few months may be able to turnaround sentiments and result in the resumption of sustained growth for the economy. We have seen the culmination of two pressing issues (Brexit and US-China issues – phase 1). Crude oil prices, geopolitical developments, and global growth are some factors that will keep impacting sentiments as well as growth. Resolution of liquidity issues and NPA menace with bolder steps (like setting up of bad bank and speeding up the judicial process across the board) is the need of the hour. Businesses, unable to adapt to new changes - GST, higher competition, technology, etc., are facing a survival threat; others are facing a cyclical downturn. Continued disruption in businesses could throw up surprises both on the upside in some cases and downside in other cases. This along with corporate governance issues and liquidity squeeze can hit small/midcaps than the largecaps. While we don't have year-end targets, we feel that Nifty could touch 12,800 in the Q1 of CY20. We think that BFSI, Metals, Oil & Gas, Automobiles, Internet-based stocks are some sectors that could do well in the coming year. The difference in performance between largecap and small/midcap will continue (though not to the same extent as in the recent past) as long as Indian stocks are driven by the fund (local or foreign) flows and not by Retail/HNI flows. While NPA worries for legacy sectors may be coming to an end, there could be fresh troubles from sectors like telecom, NBFC, Infra, Agri, MSME, Mudra, Retail that may create reasons for new worries. While the Govt has been trying its best to speed up the IBC resolution process, we need a change of mentality on the part of the judiciary, lawyers and litigants to ensure timely completion of cases. The MSCI increases in weight by 70 bps w.e.f from May 2020 ing the increasing the statutory FPI limit in a company from 24 percent to the sectoral foreign investment limit effective April 1, 2020, could bring in some FPI flows. Increasing rural spending (including to improve Agri productivity and improving education/healthcare facilities) and Infra spending across the country are the natural choices for Budget themes. However given that the revenues of the government are growing slowly, there could be a limit upto which these measures can be taken without impacting the fiscal consolidation process. The key risk events for 2020 include growth in India remaining at sub 5 percent for than 2 quarters, monsoon remaining below normal and fiscal situation not coming under control all of which may result in a run on the Rupee and on Indian equities. To hedge against these, investors can take some exposure to export-oriented companies, increase allocation to gold and debt. Investors have to watchful in markets as the cascading effect of one event onto other firms/markets is unpredictable. The quality of companies and their management will remain paramount. Disruption is the rule of the game. Investors can bring down expectations of returns, stick to quality and be clear on stocks where you would want to buy and hold. In all other stocks, investors can keep taking small profits (and in rare cases, book small losses). (The author is Head Retail Research, HDFC Securities)"

    "full_text": "Harsha Upadhyaya Most of the recent high-frequency data points have been pointing towards a continuing sluggish economy. However, largecap indices such as Nifty and Sensex have been trading near all-time highs. The contrast between the economy and the stock market is baffling to a majority of investors and financial advisors. However, if you look deeper, the ill-effects of a slowing economy is very evident in the mid and smallcap basket. While the midcap index is than 20 percent below its earlier high, the smallcap index is over 40 percent below its earlier peak. As we look back, the current market cycle started in late 2013 as optimism of the first NDA win gained momentum, thereby propelling the mid-and smallcaps to extreme outperformance over the largecaps. The sell-off since January 2018 ensured that the significant relative outperformance of mid and smallcaps disappeared completely. Over the last two years, midcaps have underperformed largecaps by over 30 percent. In our opinion, the bottoming out process of the broader market seems to have begun. We believe that incremental money is gradually moving into select midcap names. While liquidity and sentiments may continue to drive the market in the near-term, we believe that the floor for market levels has been pushed up due to lower corporate tax rates. We expect a gradual recovery in economic growth in FY21 on the back of the ing: • lagged effect of fiscal policy changes (through corporate tax cuts already implemented) • improved transmission of monetary stimulus (135bps of policy rate cuts of 2019) • improvement in the health of financial sector balance sheets resulting in a reduction in risk aversion and • some demand-side recovery as the structural changes undertaken will start impacting demand positively One of the key factors to watch out for in 2020 would be the pro-reform stance by policy-makers. In this respect, some of the key measures, which we believe would start bearing fruit, include: • Strategic disinvestment and privatisation led reforms resulting in improved fiscal headroom • Quicker resolution of the NBFC sector • Large recovery on non-performing loans under IBC paving the way for further recoveries from large accounts and strengthening of bank balance sheets • Transmission of policy rate cuts with banks moving to external benchmark linked lending rates for retail and SME loans. We remain positive on sectors such as private sector banks, capital goods, engineering, cement and gas utilities. We have also increased our exposure to Chemicals space. We are maintaining an underweight stance on consumer-driven sectors such as automobiles, durables, and FMCG on the back of weaker demand outlook.Given relative valuation comfort for mid and small caps over large caps, we believe that it is time for increasing allocation in this basket. While the volatility may remain high, we are quite optimistic about equity returns over the next year and beyond. With expectations of continued volatility in the short term, we advise equity investors to make disciplined and regular investments with long term focus, and not chase momentum in the market.

Sharekhan expects AUM growth to remain healthy (on market share gains) with spreads maintained and well-contained credit costs. Hence, the brokerage maintained its buy rating on the stock with a revised price target of Rs 2,800 per share.

Nickel has benefited from supply concerns relating to Indonesia as it halted ore exports. Soy oil gained amid robust Indian and Chinese demand and falling palm supplies. Gold and Silver benefitted from sharp ETF inflows and monetary easing by major central banks. On the flip side, natural gas slumped sharply as higher US gas production and subdued demand than offset growth in US gas exports. Zinc price also weakened amid expectations of increase in mine supply. Focus now in outlook for the year 2020. The recent upward momentum has rebuilt confidence that commodities may perform well next year as well however there are certain challenges. The biggest challenge would be in US-China deal. Commodities have rallied on expectations that US and China are close to signing phase 1 of deal in January. If there is a delay in finalizing the deal or even a fallout in talks, market confidence may crumble easily. Global economic outlook could be another hurdle. Economic indicators in last few months have shown some improvement in Chinese, US and European economies however growth concerns are far from over. China being a major commodity consumer, demand outlook may not improve significantly unless economy strengthens. Market players have also taken heart from the fact that Fed may keep interest rate unchanged till end of 2020. However, Fed’s open ended stance indicates that a lot is riding on outlook for US economy. If the US economy strengthens, market players may be quick to assume that Fed’s next step would be rate hike. While these factors will affect general market sentiment, commodity specific factors may also play a major role in price performance. Crude oil’s rally hinges on success of OPEC’s production while gold and silver have a lot reliance on ETF flows. (The author is VP - Head Commodity Research at Kotak Securities.) Disclaimer:"

    "full_text": "VK Vijayakumar During the last 27 years (1992-2019) India has been the second-fastest-growing large economy in the world with a GDP growth rate of 7 percent. But, during this long-term growth phase, the growth rate has been punctuated with temporary slowdowns in 1997, 2001-03, 2008, 2013 and now we are going through a sharp slowdown with Q2FY2020 hitting a 26 quarter low of 4.5 percent. We are likely to end FY20 with a growth rate of around 5 percent. This sharp deceleration has become an issue of major concern since the usual policy responses to slowdowns – fiscal and monetary stimulus – are becoming increasingly ineffective. To stimulate the slowing economy, the RBI cut interest rates five times in 2019 - a cumulative cut of 135 basis points. But the transmission has been poor due to rigidities in the financial system. There is no room for fiscal stimulus since the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) is close to 9 percent. The fiscal deficit of the Centre at around 3.4 percent conceals than what it reveals. If the off-budget borrowing by the FCI, NHAI etc are added to the Centre’s fiscal deficit, the number would rise above 5 percent. This, along with the deficits of the states, raises the PSBR to 9 percent of GDP, which is equivalent to the entire household savings in the entire economy. Therefore, if the fiscal deficit is allowed to rise further it will end up crowding-out private investment. It can also contribute to higher inflation, perhaps even trigger stagflation. OPINION | What finance sector expects from Union Budget 2026 IMF revises India growth outlook upwards; pegs FY26 at 7.3%, FY27 at 6.4% OPINION | Tiger Global ruling: Why India’s tax certainty debate is back in focus Therefore, the focus has to be on monetary policy and measures to improve transmission. The RBI has only signalled a pause in easing, waiting for clarity on government's deficit numbers. There is room for the central bank to cut rates by another 50 bps in 2020 since core inflation is under control. But the focus has to be on effective transmission. The major constraint in transmission is the rigidity in banks' cost of funds since deposit rates have not declined commensurate with the cut in policy rates. Banks, mainly PSU banks reeling under huge NPAs, are wary of cutting deposit rates due to fear of losing deposits to small savings which command a much higher interest rate. For instance, PPF and 5-year NSCs carry interest rate of 7.9 percent. Therefore, if the monetary transmission is to be effective, the interest rates on small savings with high-interest rates have to be reduced. Presently, the government s a policy of setting interest rates on small savings every quarter. The government may think of deviating from this policy temporarily and announce a bigger cut in interest on small savings like PPF and NSCs. Yet another factor constraining monetary transmission is the reluctance of the banks to lend. PSU banks have been gripped by a fear psychosis ing the investigations into lending by the 3 Cs (CBI, CVC and CAG). The government has to assure the bankers that genuine lending will not invite investigation. Restoring business confidence is crucial in stimulating growth.

In fact, issues from strong companies only saw investor interest. Market gave thumbs up to companies which have strong corporate governance, niche market area, monopolistic business etc. During the year, 16 companies launched their IPOs against 24 in 2018. Out of 16, only three gave than 100 percent return. Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) registered maximum return among them in a short span of time. The only catering and ticket services provider to railways clocked 190 percent rally in just two-and-half-month.

Is the Nifty at a double top? Affle (India), a mobile marketing company, was the second biggest gainer with 116 percent return in nearly five months, ed by e-commerce company IndiaMart InterMesh which shot up 112 percent in six months. \"Investors gave thumbs up to thematic IPOs across sectors ranging from technology, hospitality, microfinance, consumer, healthcare etc. Overall, investors continued to chase companies with a distinguished track record of operating and financial performance backed by strong corporate governance,\" Gaurav Sood, Co-Head Equity Capital Markets, ICICI Securities told Moneycontrol. After top three, next four stocks were also created wealth for investors as they gained than 50 percent from their issue price. Wire & cable manufacturer company Polycab India rallied 84 percent, Neogen Chemicals gained 68.6 percent, diagnostic services provider Metropolis Healthcare climbed 63 percent and Vishwaraj Sugar Industries surged 50.08 percent during the year. There are six stocks which also did not disappoint investors as they have given 15-50 percent return, which was far higher than Nifty50 (rising nearly 13 percent this year) and Nifty Midcap (which lost 4.5 percent). These six stocks are Ujjivan Small Finance Bank, Spandana Sphoorty Financial, Chalet Hotels, MSTC, Rail Vikas Nigam and CSB Bank. However, a few stocks disappointed the Street - Prince Pipes & Fittings (listed on December 30 and lost 6.4 percent) and Sterling & Wilson Solar (shed 60 percent). In case of Sterling, the major loss was occurred after its promoters deferred debt repayment. Xelpmoc Design & Tech, which the small issue in size (Rs 23 crore), lost 4.5 percent this year. These 16 companies in total raised Rs 12,361.56 crore through public issues with Sterling & Wilson (Rs 2,850 crore), Chalet Hotels (Rs 1,641 crore), Polycab India (Rs 1,345 crore), Metropolis Healthcare (Rs 1,204 crore) and Spandana Sphoorty (Rs 1,190 crore) being the biggest IPOs this year. With the start of optimism after government measures, most experts expect the next year i.e. 2020 to be better for primary market than 2019 as they feel lot of big IPOs including SBI Cards, UTI AMC etc are going to hit the capital market and the amount they in total raised is expected to be nearly double. \"A lot of new issues (IPOs) are lined up in 2020, some of which could have the potential to create long term wealth,\" Siddhartha Khemka, Senior Vice President | Head-Retail Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services said."

Concerns over fiscal prudence and plans to use funds from the centre, state and private due to lack of liquidity limited upside for the market. The index d in a tight band of around 30 points after initial one and half hours of trading and formed bearish candle which resembles a Spinning Top pattern on daily charts as trading remained listless through out the session. A Spinning Top is often regarded as a neutral pattern that suggests indecisiveness in the market. It can be formed in an uptrend as well as in a downtrend. Experts feel the consolidation is expected to continue in coming sessions and 12,150 could remain crucial for further directional move. The Nifty50 after opening sharply higher at 12,202.15, extended the rally and hit an intra of 12,222.20, but after initial one-and-half-hour of trading, it wiped out early gains and turned volatile for rest of the session to hit a day's low of 12,165.30.

India VIX fell by 0.62 percent to 11.59 levels. Volatility index has seen some recovery from lower levels which has given a pause in positive momentum but overall lower volatility indicates that declines could be bought in the market. \"One has to be cautious if VIX bottoms out and surpasses above 12-13 levels, in that scenario wider swing may be seen in the market,\" Chandan Taparia, Vice President | Analyst-Derivatives at Motilal Oswal Financial Services said. On January options front, maximum Put open interest was seen at 12,000 ed by 11,500 strike, while maximum Call open interest was seen at 12,500 ed by 12,200 strike. Call writing was seen in 12,300 and 12,500 strikes while Put writing was seen at 11,800 then 11,900 strike. Abovementioned Option data suggests a wider trading range for Nifty at 12,000-12,500 levels. Bank Nifty remained negative to rangebound for the most part of the session but managed to hold key support of 32,000 mark. The index fell 0.18 percent to 32,102.90 and formed a small bearish candle on the daily scale. \"It has been making lower highs - lower lows from the last two sessions but got stuck in between 32,000 to 32,600 levels from the last eleven trading sessions. However till the time, Bank Nifty sustains above 32,000 mark, we maintain our positive to rangebound bias towards 32,250 then 32,500-32,600 levels. However, if it fails to hold 32,000 then there could be some profit booking towards 31,850-31,783,\" Chandan Taparia said."
