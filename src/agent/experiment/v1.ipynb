Gross Domestic Product is the market value of all finished goods and services produced within a country in a year. Think about the economy like a giant supermarket filled with millions of goods, like dresses, and washing machines, and services, like dog walking and massages. Every time a finished good or service is sold, we ring up the price. At the end of the year, we ring up the total -- that\\'s the GDP. [...] Let\\'s go back to the definition one more time, to see some of the limits of GDP as a measure of economic production. GDP is the market value of all finished goods and services produced within a country in a year. If a good isn\\'t bought and sold in a market, then it\\'s not typically counted in GDP. Why not? Counting the market value of, say, all the breakfast cereal produced in the U.S. is easy, at least in principle. Just add up the price every time a box of cereal is sold. Since market prices are observable, every statistician who counts carefully will come up with pretty much the same number. But, without market prices, there\\'s no easy or agreed upon way to calculate how much a good is worth. Polar bears, for example, aren\\'t counted in GDP. [...] Instructor:  Alex Tabarrok, George Mason University\\n\\nPicture the economy as a giant supermarket, with billions of goods and services inside. At the checkout line, you watch as the cashier rings up the price for each finished good or service sold. What have you just observed?\\n\\nThe cashier is computing a very important number: gross domestic product, or GDP.\\n\\nGDP is the market value of all finished goods and services, produced within a country in a year.\\n\\nBut, what does \"market value\" mean?

The two would be the same if all of the productive enterprises in a country were owned by its own citizens and those citizens did not own productive enterprises in any other countries. In practice, however, foreign ownership makes GDP and GNI non-identical. Production within a country's borders, but by an enterprise owned by somebody outside the country, counts as part of its GDP but not its GNI; on the other hand, production by an enterprise located outside the country, but owned by one of its citizens, counts as part of its GNI but not its GDP. For example, the GNI of the US is the value of output produced by American-owned firms, regardless of where the firms are [...] Sustainability of growth – GDP is a measurement of economic historic activity and is not necessarily a projection.\\n Income distribution – GDP does not account for variances in incomes of various demographic groups.

It includes salaries of public servants, purchases of weapons for the military and any investment expenditure by a government. It does not include any transfer payments, such as social security or unemployment benefits.

One way gross domestic product (GDP) is calculated—known as the expenditure approach—is by adding the expenditures made by those three groups of users.

[...] What about the black/grey or informal economy?\\n\\nGDP includes estimates of all unreported transactions happening beyond the formal economy, for example untracked cash payments to a worker whose work is not declared to the authorities (therefore not registered for taxes and not eligible for social security). Other activities considered illegal in most countries are also estimated to calculate GDP, such as buying counterfeit goods, smuggled cigarettes and drugs, and prostitution.',\n",

The company\\'s strategic acquisitions and growth in its retail and digital segments are key drivers.\\n\\nHowever, the recent miss on profit expectations, coupled with macroeconomic uncertainties and a weak short-term earnings forecast, introduces a degree of caution. The signal\\'s LTP of ₹1419.60 is positioned within the stock\\'s rising trend but also near its yearly high, suggesting a potential for volatility.\\n\\n**Decision Point:** The signal appears actionable for a long position, aligning with strong expert consensus and positive long-term technicals. A strategy acknowledging potential short-term volatility due to recent earnings news and macroeconomic factors would be prudent.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}], additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.5-pro', 'safety_ratings': [], 'model_provider': 'google_genai'}, id='lc_run--019c5be5-c039-7c53-86ed-fca2b1d91acc-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 20841, 'output_tokens': 925, 'total_tokens': 21766, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 345}})]}})\n",

The company\\'s strategic acquisitions and growth in its retail and digital segments are key drivers.\\n\\nHowever, the recent miss on profit expectations, coupled with macroeconomic uncertainties and a weak short-term earnings forecast, introduces a degree of caution. The signal\\'s LTP of ₹1419.60 is positioned within the stock\\'s rising trend but also near its yearly high, suggesting a potential for volatility.\\n\\n**Decision Point:** The signal appears actionable for a long position, aligning with strong expert consensus and positive long-term technicals.
